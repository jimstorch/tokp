# Basic Coding Standards for Contributors #

  * Indenting is 4 spaces, not tabs
  * Wrap lines at or before the 79th character
  * Module Import Order (separate groups with a newline)
    1. Built in Python modules first
    1. External Libraries
    1. Modules local to the project


# Naming Conventions #

  * Classes = CamelCaseWithLeadingCaps.
  * modules = all lowercase with underbar separators (use sparingly)
  * variables, function, and method names = all lowercase with underbar separators.  Variables and methods that are only referenced internally within a class can start with an underbar.
