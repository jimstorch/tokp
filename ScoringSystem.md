## Loot Values ##
Loot values are named in accordance with WoW loot types. This naming convention is only for the purpose of establishing a recognizable system of **personal loot value**. The loot values are: EPIC, RARE, UNCOMMON, and ZG. ZG loots are only for use in 10-man instances. EPIC, RARE and UNCOMMON loots are only for use in 25-man instances.

## Earning Points ##
Points are earned in 4 categories: EPIC, RARE, UNCOMMON and ZG. Points are earned at the same rate in each category. Points are awarded per day (though not always recomputed every day) based on percentage attendance for the previous week. Weekly attendance begins and ends on Tuesday morning. All categories are capped at 100 points.

| **Participation Level** | **Min Attendance** | **Max Attendance** | **Points Per Week** |
|:------------------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|:--------------------|
| 4 | 75% | 100% |14.00 |
| 3 | 50% | 75% |11.75 |
| 2 | 25% | 50% |9.00 |
| 1 | 10% | 25% |5.75 |
| 0.5 | 0% | 10% |0.00 |

In addition, raids of more significance to guild progression will receive higher weighting towards weekly attendance.
| **Raid Type** | **Weighting** |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| 10-man "Farm Status" | 1 |
| 10-man "New Content" | 2 |
| 25-man "Farm Status" | 2 |
| 25-man "New Content" | 4 |


## Bonus Points ##
Bonus points may be added to recognize events other than attendance. These points will be added to all point totals simultaneously.


## Losing Points ##
Consistent failure to participate will result in point decay. Points do not decay below 0. Point totals below 0 at the beginning of decay will not change. From the cap of 100 points, it will take 12 weeks of inactivity to reach 0 points.

**Weeks in a row without attending a Raid:**
| 1 | 0 per week |
|:--|:-----------|
| 2 | -2 per week |
| 3 | -4 per week |
| 4 | -8 per week |
| 5+ | -10 per week |


## Bidding on Items ##
Points are spent on items from raids. Members may bid silently (whispers) by item value (EPIC, RARE, UNCOMMON). Each bid represents the highest item value that the member is willing to spend on the item. Only the highest item value bid will be considered. The member with the highest score item value being considered wins the item. Applicants and Alternates may not win over a Main.

### Item Cost ###
For each category at or below the winning item level, the category score is "reset".
For each category above the winning level, the category loses points equal to the winning item level value.

| **Item Level** | **Value** |
|:---------------|:----------|
| Epic | 20 |
| Rare | 6 |
| Uncommon | 3 |
| ZG | 1 |

### Point Reset ###
When a category is reset, it is reduced by 75%. This reduction bounded below by 20 and above by 50.

## Special Items ##
Some items, such as tradeskill recipes and BoP ingredients, will not be assigned by the spending of points. These items are dealt with at the discretion of the raid leader. These items appear in loot reports as "special" and do not cost any points.
