2/1 15:52:34.203  Zoelyn whispers: Shagz
2/1 15:53:09.453  To Zoelyn: in the past we've always made an effort to prevent that sort of rolling, maybe its time to talk to kauzn and shagz again about guild priority
2/1 15:53:16.156  Zoelyn whispers: see whats happening and even though shagz was most likely completely fair...its the perspective of others.

2/10 23:25:15.578  [7. tokheal] Crush: im gonna toss the large heals this time and use the pea and see how that works i mean if it cuts my large heal in half that is still more than the little one

2/21 11:55:09.640  Futile whispers: well, I just really want it for farming, so in towns isn't any problem for me

2/21 12:48:38.265  [4. tokheal] Bansheel: the easiest to use is a combo of game pad and heal bot...but in a panic I always default to xpearl and keyboard, since thats what i started with my fingers know where to go with less though
